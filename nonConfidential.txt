This is the most amazing class I've ever been a part of. EVERY SINGLE DAY, I wake up in the morning with only one thing on my mind: this class. The class is so insanely amazing that I cannot fathom life without it anymore. Never again will I enjoy a class more than I enjoy this one. It is my everything, my life, my being. I yearn to spend the rest of m days in this very classroom, typing lines of code til my very last breath.
